# Google Homepage Project
This project is part of The Odin Project.

I will be cloning the Google Homepage by using Chrome Inspect tools to give me an idea of the HTML and CSS behind the Google homepage. I will then be using these tools to write up my own HTML and CSS that together will display like the Google homepage.
