# Reflection

I used Chrome inspect tools on the Google homepage to identify styling attributes of various items. I also viewed other students' solutions to obtain svg images of the magnifying icon and microphone icon. Initally, I was unable to re-create anything properly and was tempted to just copy another student's solution but I would only be cheating myself because I wouldn't be learning much. This isn't going to be a showcase portfolio item, it is only for my own learning anyway. So I called it a day and took some rest.

After a period of recovery, I started again from scratch. I had difficulty implementing the search field. On inspection, I discovered that the search field consisted of a rounded div with another input inside. I used CSS styling by inspecting this on the Google homepage.

Another difficulty I came across was splitting the navigation and footer items left and right. One solution I came across was to insert some spacing between the left and right items. However, this did not seem like the most optimal solution and I wondered whether there must be efficient ways to organise this using flex. I managed to make it partially work, however, when adding the Google apps grid icon and the user profile picture icon, I was unable to make the navigation items align properly along a horizontal centre line. For simplicity sake, I left the navigation items on the top and footer next to each other.

To improve, I would explore arranging the navigation items properly on the left and right. Another thing I would like to have implemented is narrowing of the search bar when the viewport is narrowed. I was not able to do this properly but is something I would like to experiment.

Overall, I am pleased with how the final solution appears. Of course, there are many more features to do but to avoid focusing on the minute details and spending forever on this project I am calling it a day. I am happy that the graphics are svg and with the hover shadow of the search bar, as well as the buttons which appears similar to the actual Google homepage.
